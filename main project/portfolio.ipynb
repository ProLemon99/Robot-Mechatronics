    "Our task is to program a Lego EV3 robot in micropython to autonomously move a red and a yellow Lego block into a goal zone without touching the blue and green blocks. The robot will also need to be tested multiple times thoroughly to ensure the functionality of the robots. Efficiency is key, overcomplicated code will only reduce efficiency and consistency. The robot will also need to be tested multiple times thoroughly to ensure the functionality of the robots. We will need to conduct lots of tests and apply problem-solving skills in order to achieve our goal."

    "Our idea is to make the robot have long prongs to be able to either have the prongs go through the block or entrap the block between the prongs to move the block to the goal and then reverse out of it to leave the block in place. We are opting to not use the light or touch sensor in our project. We may use the Ultrasonic sensor but have concerns that external environmental variables will cause this not to work. By going for simple attachments and programming logic we will have the highest chance of getting the box into the two squares."

    "### **Success Criteria**\n",
    "#### Functional requirements\n",
    "* Be able to move forward, backward, and turn. \n",
    "   * The robot needs to be able to move forward and backward as it needs to move in order to collect the blocks.\n",
    "* Be able to make a block move into a desired position. \n",
    "   * The robot will need high-functional practical attachments that can easily pick up the blocks without trouble and allow for a small amount of error.\n",
    "* Be able to avoid collisions with other blocks. \n",
    "   * By having the robot at a sensible and practical size we can avoid collisions along with predefined logic and/or sensor data.\n",
    "* Make decisions without human intervention by using sensor and/or predefined logic. \n",
    "   * The robot must not use human interaction to complete its task, it needs to make decisions without human interaction to count as a valid test. It can achieve this by using sensor data (colour sensor, touch sensor and Ultrasonic sensor) or by using measurements to move the robot around.\n",
    "#### Non-functional requirements\n",
    "* Have neat cable management. \n",
    "   * Organising the wiring can improve aesthetics and make sure that wires will not drag along the ground which slightly improves reliability as the wires won’t get caught or tangled.\n",
    "* Have matching colour attachments. \n",
    "   * Improve aesthetics and having the exact same attachments on both sides make the attachment simpler to repair and replace. We can quickly identify if an attachment is broken by looking at the symmetrical attachment on the other side.\n",
    "* Have easy access to the buttons on the EV3 (to run the program). \n",
    "   * By having easy access to the run and play buttons allows us to use the EV3 software more conveniently.\n",
    "* Fast speed. \n",
    "   * Having a faster speed means that the robot can conduct more tests in a shorter amount of time.\n",
    "* Scalability. \n",
    "   * The program can be easily modified for future programs or more challenges."

    "My final test case was successful. I programmed my robot in a very simple way, without using much code or effort. If I compare the robot to the functional success criteria, I would say that my robot has achieved success. My robot was able to move forward, move backward, and turn, which are part of the most important criteria rules. I programmed the robot so that it was able to move a block into a desired location by grabbing the block and hooking it onto or in between the prongs. The robot was also able to avoid touching the other blocks due to the measurements and calculated angles being very precise. Eventually after some testing, my robot was also able to successfully bring the desired blocks back to the base without hitting any other blocks or falling off the board without any human intervention. The code was written well, and the measurements have been made correctly.\n",

    "**Evaluation of your INDIVIDUAL Final Test Case in Relation to Non-Functional Criteria**\n",

    "In terms of non-functional success criteria, I still did a very good job. The cables attached to the robot were sorted out neatly before the testing stages to prevent the robot’s wheel from getting stuck on its cables. For the attachments, I found Lego pieces that matched exactly one another in terms of colors and length, and built two same prongs to be used on the robot as a modification. The robot also comes with easy access to the buttons on the EV3 used to run the program. In terms of speed, although it's not at the fastest, the robot still moved decently fast, but I would not say that this criteria was **FULLY** achieved. In terms of scalability, both of the prongs are quite small in size, and it was always easy to attach and detach the pieces from the EV3. There never really was a struggle I faced when it comes to attaching and detaching the pieces as they can be added and removed from the EV3 with minimal effort, so I can confidently say that I have managed that as well.\n",

    "\n",
    "For our group’s final robot performance, the needs were mostly satisfied. The robot was able to complete the task and comply with the task’s rules without any rule violations or failures through its well-tested and fluent code. The robot worked functionally, reliably, and efficiently, without the code needing too much effort to write and the modifications requiring too many parts. The code was written precisely by our team members with decent knowledge and experience in robotics and coding. The robot in the final test had not bumped into the forbidden blocks and managed to carry the desired blocks back to the base, resulting in ultimate success.\n",

    "We managed the project very easily and efficiently. We contributed many hours of our lives writing the code and testing the robots, as well as making any necessary adjustments that should be made to improve the robot. We were very wise with our time, spending the desired amount of time on parts. We were also able to get over the stages of coding the robot very quickly, and we were able to move on to the next part easily and efficiently. We had not wasted any time on other trivial things, and the robot was our primary concern. As professional builders and programmers, we mostly did not face any real challenges.\n",

    "**Evaluation of Project in Relation to Team Collaboration**\n",
    "\n",
    "The team collaborated very well. We were always supportive of other people’s ideas and we used thorough and frequent communication to discuss ideas to use on our robot. Because of us all being very cooperative and cheerful, we combined ideas to program the best robot possible. Each team member did their part, and we worked together to write the code and build the modifications. Ideas on how the robot should bring the desired blocks back to the base were also discussed between us all, and it did not take us long to find a good idea of how the robot could bring the desired blocks back to the base.\n",

    "**Identification and Evaluation of Future Improvements to your Final Product**\n",
    "\n",
    "For future improvements to our robot, I would choose to remove the current modifications from the robot and brainstorm a completely new mechanic for a modification that is very special and brilliant, an idea that a commoner cannot easily brainstorm. Instead of adding prongs and letting the robot carry the blocks in between them, this new mechanic can be the robot using code and parts that can for example allow the robot to lift the part high in the air and put it down when it reaches the base. Because many people had first thought about prongs as a modification and letting the blocks slide in between the prongs as the mechanic, this modification idea is not special, so we could dedicate more time to creating a well-planned and thought-out modification idea that stands out from other people’s ideas. We could also make the code fancier, such as adding extra complex code and letting the robot perform unnecessary actions that could act as a flex to the audience, showing them how smart we are as programmers, and potentially creating admiration. However, this will not mess with the functionality of the robot, and we will program the robot in a way that makes it more spectacular but does not let it mess with the current success standards."
